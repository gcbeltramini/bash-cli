# Commands

This folder contains all CLI commands. The `commands` folder can contain subfolders with helper functions
used only by that command.

The first line of the command description is shown in the autocomplete in zsh, so we suggest to
write a short description in the first line and give a more detailed explanation in the other lines.

And the first line of the parameters description in the section `Options` is shown in the autocomplete in zsh.
