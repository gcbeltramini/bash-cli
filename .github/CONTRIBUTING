## Creating a new command

Let's suppose that you want to create the command `mycli new-cmd new-subcmd`.

1. Create a new folder called `new-cmd` inside the `commands` directory, if it doesn't already exist.
2. Create a new file called `new-subcmd.sh` in the folder `commands/new-cmd`.
3. Make sure that the file can be executed: `chmod +x commands/new-cmd/new-subcmd.sh`
4. Use the content of another file as template.
   1. The help text should start with `##?` and follow the [docopt](http://docopt.org/) convention.
      Note that the `Usage` and `Options` sections define how the command will be used. Everything
      else is ignored by the parser.
   2. To check if the input arguments are being correctly parsed, run `MYCLI_DEBUG=1 mycli new-cmd new-subcmd`
      with the proper inputs. You should see the parsed arguments at the end of the debugging output.
