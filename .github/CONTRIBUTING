## Creating a new command

Let's suppose that you want to create the command `mycli new-cmd new-subcmd`.

1. Create a new folder called `new-cmd` in the folder `commands`, if it doesn't exist already.
2. Create a new file called `new-subcmd.sh` in the folder `commands/new-cmd`
3. Make sure that the file can be executed: `chmod +x commands/new-cmd/new-subcmd.sh`
4. Copy the content of another file to use as template.
   1. The help text should start with `##? ` and follows the [docopt](http://docopt.org/) convention.
   Note that the `Usage` and `Options` sections define how the command will be used.
